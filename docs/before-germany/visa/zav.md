# ZAV

The ZAV document is issued by the Federal Employment Agency in Germany. It certifies that the holder is qualified to work in Germany.

While this document is not always required, it can be beneficial in the following cases:

- **Expediting the work visa process**: It can help speed up the visa issuance process at the embassy.
- **Avoiding visa rejection due to lack of qualifications**: If you do not have higher education degrees, this document can reduce the risk of your visa application being rejected for insufficient qualifications.

The company offering you the job contract is responsible for obtaining this document.

For any questions or inquiries, you can contact the ZAV via email: [zav@arbeitsagentur.de](mailto:zav@arbeitsagentur.de).
