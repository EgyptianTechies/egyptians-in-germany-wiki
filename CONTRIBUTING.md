## **⚠️ Important Guidelines**

🚫 **No Direct Pushes to `gh-pages`**
The `gh-pages` branch is used for deployment. All changes should go through a **Pull Request** and be merged properly.

📖 **Follow the Content Structure**
Ensure that pages are well-organized and easy to navigate. Use appropriate headings, bullet points, and tables where needed.

🌍 **Language & Formatting**
- Use **clear and simple language**.
- If translating, ensure accuracy and clarity.
- Use **Markdown** formatting (e.g., `#` for headings, `**bold**` for emphasis).

---

## **📡 How the Project is Deployed?**

This project uses **GitHub Pages** and **Docusaurus** for hosting.
- Every change merged into `main` is **automatically deployed** to `gh-pages` via GitHub Actions.
- You **don’t need** to manually deploy—just focus on improving the content!
